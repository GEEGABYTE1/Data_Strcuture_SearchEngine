# More Information 

These data structures and algorithms have only been made in Python and may or may not reflect other data structures and algorithms completely in other languages. 

Stated time complexitites for both algorithms and data structures (for some) are base complexities and are not unique to the specific methods. 

Some data structures shown may require prior knowledge of previous data structures which are shown seperately.

The Node class was added although not a formal data structure, since it is the root of all basic data structures.

Some algorithms may have two files listed. They are separated by a dash line to indicate to the user which file the script is apart of.

*Users must have sufficient knowledge in computer science and also Python to understand the content*

*To fully experience the whole program, run `user.py`.*
