# More Information 

These data structures and algorithms have only been made in Python and may or may not reflect other data structures and algorithms completely in other languages. 

Stated time complexitites for both algorithms and data structures (for some) are base complexities and are not unique to the specific methods. 

Some data structures shown may require prior knowledge of previous data structures which are shown seperately.

The Node class was added although not a formal data structure, since it is the root of all basic data structures.
